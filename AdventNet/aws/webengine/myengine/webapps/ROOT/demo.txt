A byte buffer.
This class defines six categories of operations upon byte buffers:

Absolute and relative get and put methods that read and write single bytes;

Relative bulk get methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from this buffer into an array;

Relative bulk put methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from a byte array or some other byte buffer into this buffer;

Absolute and relative get and put methods that read and write values of other primitive types, translating them to and from sequences of bytes in a particular byte order;

Methods for creating view buffers, which allow a byte buffer to be viewed as a buffer containing values of some other primitive type; and

Methods for compacting, duplicating, and slicing a byte buffer.

Byte buffers can be created either by allocation, which allocates space for the buffer's content, or by wrapping an existing byte array into a buffer.
